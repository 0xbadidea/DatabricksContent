# Query Databricks Data in Scala

A common ask for many engineers that use Databricks is the ability to query data outside of Databricks. 


Download the Jar files from Databricks, and copy the SparkJDBC42.jar file to the directory of your Scala file. 

To run the project 
```
scala -classpath SparkJDBC42.jar ScalaSqlAnalyticsConnect.scala
```
