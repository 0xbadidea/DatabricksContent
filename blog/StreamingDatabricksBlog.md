# Streaming Machine Learning Solutions With Azure Databricks


Real-time reporting, alerts, and predictions is a common ask for business of all sizes, however, they rarely understand the requirements or implementation to achieve that level of data processing.  Organizations are beginning not only benefit from streaming data solutions, but require them to differentiate themselves from their competitiors. **Streaming data** is data that is either generated continuously or consumed continuously. Streaming data is typically includes many data sources, and a wide variety of sources such as log files, point of sale data (in store and online), financial data and IoT Devices. 

## Implementation
### Fast and Easy
Generating business changing insights from streaming data can be a difficult process, however, there are quick wins for organizations of all sizes. 

It is extremely easy to set up data pipelines to extract data from your social media pages, analyze them for sentiment analysis, and alert users when comments or posts need to be address. While this may not be a busniess changing solution. It gives companies the ability to have a more inteimate level of interaction with the customers or users that they did not have before. Simply using Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft Cognitive Services, one can be alerted of any positive or negative tweet that occurs about their company. This is a simple and cost effective way to implement intelligence into a workflow. 

### Most Beneficial 
From my experience, most companies benefit from custom machine learning solutions that solve a specific business problem using their own data. This is a customer solution toilerd to solve a solution in a specific environment. However, the cost of implementing custom and scalable solutions is often a barrier for organizations because the return on investment (ROI) is just not there. 

Azure Databricks is an optimized platform for Apache Spark, and enables organizations to easily implement streaming data and preditive analytics (machine learning and deep learning) solutions. It is common for organizations to implement batch processes in Azure Databricks to save on cloud consumption costs, while knowing that they are planning for the future. Azure Databricks is a managed Apache Spark offering that works great for batch and streaming processes, meaning that you can save money intially by turning off your VMs when real-time insights is not needed, but can simply flip a switch for streaming data. Deploy cost effective infrastructure now with the ability to scale limitlessly as you need in the future. 


## Benefits
Streaming data archetecture is beneficial in most scenarios where new, dynamic data is generated on a continual basis. Any industry can benefit from data being available almost instantly from the time it was created. Most organizations will begin with simple solutions to collect log data, detect out-liers based off set (unintelligent) rules, or provide real-time reporting. However, they will evolve to become more sophisticated data processing pipelines that can detect fraudulant charges as they occur. The true advantage of streaming data is to perform advanced tasks, like machine learning, where over time we create a complex stream of events, where we apply advanced algorithms to take preventative action.
