# Summary

In general this demo showed you how to implement a Delta Lake using Databricks Delta. This demo did simplify the process **A TON** but the ideas scale extremely well. Delta Lake is the ideal storage location for structured and unstructure data no matter the size. Databricks makes it easy by providing a seemless integration point between your data storage, data pipelines, and data serving.
